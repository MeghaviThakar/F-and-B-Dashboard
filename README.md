Food and Beverage Performance Dashboard

I have developed a food and beverage performance dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of my business. The dashboard includes four pages:

Overview: 
This page provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total sales, average order value, etc.
Sales Report: This page provides a detailed breakdown of sales data, including top and bottom selling products, most popular days and times, and sales by demographics.
Demographics: This page provides insights into customer demographics, such as age, gender, location, and type of membership.
Marketing Data: This page provides information on marketing campaigns, including profit, cost, impressions, and click-through rate (CTR).

The dashboard is built using a variety of data sources, including the following:

Calendar table: This table contains information about dates, times, and days of the week.
Demographics table: This table contains information about customers, such as age, gender, location, and type of membership.
Marketing table: This table contains information about marketing campaigns, such as campaign name, campaign type, and budget.
Menu table: This table contains information about menu items, such as item name, price, and category.
Sales table: This table contains information about sales transactions, such as product name, quantity sold, and price.

The dashboard uses a variety of charts and graphs to visualize the data. This allows me to quickly identify any trends or patterns in the data.

How to use the food and beverage performance dashboard to improve your business:

Identify your best-selling and worst-selling products:This information can be used to focus your marketing efforts on the products that are most profitable, and to remove products from your menu that are not selling well.
Identify your most popular days and times of day: This information can be used to staff your business appropriately and to ensure that you have enough inventory on hand. For example, if you know that Saturdays are your busiest day of the week, you can schedule more staff to work on Saturdays and order more inventory for that day.
Segment your customer base and target your marketing efforts more effectively: This information can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to be successful. For example, if you know that your most popular customers are women between the ages of 25 and 35, you can create marketing campaigns that are specifically targeted to this demographic.
Track the performance of your marketing campaigns and identify which campaigns are most effective: This information can be used to allocate your marketing budget more wisely. For example, if you know that a particular marketing campaign is not generating the desired results, you can reduce your spending on that campaign and allocate your budget to other campaigns that are more effective.
